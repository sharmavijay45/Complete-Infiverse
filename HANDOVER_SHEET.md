# Project Handover & Feature Status

## 1. Overview

This document provides a clear handover of the Employee Monitoring System, detailing the original development plan, confirming the completion status of its core components, and outlining the final pending tasks required for full integration and polish.

## 2. Employee Monitoring System: Feature Completion Status

The core system, originally planned as a 6-day sprint, is now functionally complete. The backend services, data models, and API endpoints have been implemented. The following checklist summarizes the status of the key deliverables from the original plan:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Screen capture module | ✅ Completed | Captures are stored on Cloudinary. Logic for delta-based capture is in place to save space. |
| Keystroke and mouse activity tracker | ✅ Completed | The `keystrokeAnalytics.js` service handles activity level tracking (not content). |
| Website switch detector + screenshot | ✅ Completed | `websiteMonitor.js` and `intelligentScreenCapture.js` work together to detect off-task activity and trigger captures. |
| Alert system (JSON + optional webhook) | ⚠️ Needs Final Polish | Alerts are saved to the database via `MonitoringAlert.js`. The final webhook/push notification trigger is a pending task. |
| Logs organized + secured | ✅ Completed | All logs and captures are associated with employee IDs and require authentication for access. |
| Integrated with task timelines | ⚠️ Needs Final Polish | The data is timestamped, but the UI to correlate activity directly with task time ranges is a pending frontend task. |
| Report generator (summary, screenshots) | ✅ Completed | The `reportGenerator.js` service can create PDF/CSV reports. |
| CLI or frontend viewer for managers | ✅ Completed | The React frontend provides a comprehensive interface for viewing reports, alerts, and screenshots. |
| Configurable, tested, and clean | ✅ Completed | Intervals and settings are configurable in the `.env` file. The codebase has been cleaned of debug logs. |

## 3. Confirmation of Recently Completed Tasks (Vijay's Tasks)

This section confirms that the most recent set of backend, AI, and compliance tasks have been successfully implemented and integrated into the codebase.

#### 1. Privacy & Consent Layer
-   **Status**: ✅ **Completed**
-   **Evidence**: The `/api/consent` route has been implemented in `server/routes/consent.js`. The `User` model (`server/models/User.js`) now includes the `monitoringPaused` flag and the `dataRetentionPeriod` field to support this functionality.

#### 2. Disallowed-Site Alerts
-   **Status**: ✅ **Completed**
-   **Evidence**: The monitoring service (`server/services/websiteMonitor.js`) actively checks visited URLs. If a site is found in `disallowed_sites.json`, the `intelligentScreenCapture.js` service is triggered to capture a screenshot, and a `MonitoringAlert` record is created in the database. These alerts are served via the `/api/alerts` endpoint.

#### 3. Audit Logs + Compliance
-   **Status**: ✅ **Completed**
-   **Evidence**: The `AuditLog` model (`server/models/AuditLog.js`) is in place to create an immutable record of key system events. A foundational `GDPR.md` policy has been added to the `/docs` directory.

#### 4. AI Tie-in Refinement
-   **Status**: ✅ **Completed**
-   **Evidence**: The `ScreenCapture` model now contains a `metadata.ai_analysis` field. This field is designed to hold the "explainability" data from the AI service (e.g., `activityType`, `taskRelevance`), which can be pulled into reports to explain why a productivity score was given.

## 4. Final Pending Tasks for Full Integration

While the core features are built, the following tasks are pending to complete the full, seamless integration of the system.

-   **Alert Notifications (Backend)**
    -   **Task**: The alert system currently saves `MonitoringAlert` records to the database. The final step is to integrate this with the `pushNotificationService.js` and `emailService.js`. When a high-severity alert is created, it should immediately trigger a real-time push notification and/or an email to the relevant administrator or manager.

-   **Data Retention Automation (Backend)**
    -   **Task**: The `User` model has the necessary fields (`monitoringPaused`, `dataRetentionPeriod`). A background job (e.g., a cron job or a `setInterval` loop) needs to be created on the server. This job should periodically scan for users who have revoked consent or been deactivated and automatically delete their monitoring data (screenshots, activity logs) once their retention period has expired.

-   **Report Explainability UI (Frontend)**
    -   **Task**: The backend now provides AI explainability data in the API responses. The frontend reporting interface needs to be polished to display this information clearly. For example, next to a low productivity score, the UI should render the reason (e.g., "*Score impacted by 25% of activity on non-productive sites*).

-   **Task Timeline Integration (Frontend)**
    -   **Task**: The backend data includes all necessary timestamps. A new UI feature needs to be built on the task details page. This feature would allow a manager to select a task and see a timeline of all monitoring activity (activity logs, screenshots, alerts) that occurred while that task was in progress.
