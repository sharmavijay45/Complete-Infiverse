## 1. Overview & System Architecture

The Infiverse server is a powerful Node.js application designed for comprehensive workforce management and AI-driven productivity analysis. It serves as the backbone for a sophisticated system that includes employee monitoring, task management, HR functionalities (attendance, leave, salary), and real-time analytics.

### 1.1. Core Technologies

-   **Runtime**: Node.js
-   **Framework**: Express.js
-   **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
-   **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
-   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini for insights and analysis.
-   **Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary for media (screen captures).
-   **Email Service**: Nodemailer for transactional emails.
-   **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### 1.2. Architectural Flow

The server follows a modular, service-oriented architecture:

1.  **Routes (`routes/`)**: Define the API endpoints. They receive HTTP requests, validate them (often using `express-validator`), and pass them to the appropriate controllers/services.
2.  **Middleware (`middleware/`)**: Functions that run between the request and the response. `auth.js` is a key middleware that protects routes by verifying JWTs. `adminAuth.js` provides an additional layer for admin-only routes.
3.  **Services (`services/`)**: Contain the core business logic. They are responsible for complex operations, interacting with the database, and integrating with external services (like AI and Cloudinary).
4.  **Models (`models/`)**: Define the Mongoose schemas for our MongoDB collections. They represent the structure of the application's data and include methods for data validation, virtual properties, and static helpers.
5.  **Utils (`utils/`)**: A collection of helper functions for common tasks like sending emails (`emailService.js`) or handling file uploads (`cloudinary.js`).

-   **`activityTracker.js`**: Manages the tracking of user activity, such as keystrokes and mouse movements, to determine idle time.
-   **`attendanceService.js`**: Contains the logic for handling attendance-related operations, such as processing biometric data and verifying attendance records.
-   **`intelligentScreenCapture.js`**: The core of the smart monitoring system. It decides *when* to take a screenshot based on user activity (e.g., visiting an unauthorized site) rather than just at a fixed interval.
-   **`ocrAnalysisService.js`**: Uses Tesseract.js to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on screen captures to extract text for analysis.
-   **`groqAIService.js` / `gemini-ai.js`**: Interfaces with the external AI APIs to send data and receive analysis.
-   **`salaryCalculator.js` / `enhancedSalaryCalculator.js`**: Contain the complex logic for calculating monthly payroll based on salary structures, attendance, and adjustments.
-   **`websiteMonitor.js`**: Tracks the websites and applications used by employees and checks them against the `WebsiteWhitelist`.
-   **`reportGenerator.js`**: Generates PDF and CSV reports for various modules like attendance and monitoring.

## 5. Local Setup & Deployment

### 5.1. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**.
2.  **Navigate to the `server` directory**: `cd Handover-Infi/server`
3.  **Install dependencies**: `npm install`

### 5.2. Environment Variables

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory by copying `.env.example`.
2.  Fill in all required variables:
    -   `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    -   `JWT_SECRET`: A long, random string for signing tokens.
    -   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key.
    -   `CLOUDINARY_*`: Your Cloudinary credentials.
    -   `EMAIL_USER` & `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Credentials for your email service.

### 5.3. Running the Server

-   **Development**: `npm run start` (uses `nodemon` for auto-restarts).
-   **Production**: `node index.js`

### 5.4. Deployment

The server is designed to be deployed on platforms like Heroku, Render, or any service that supports Node.js applications. Ensure that all environment variables from the `.env` file are set in the deployment environment's configuration.

## 6. Pending Tasks & Handover Plan

This section outlines the key features and improvements that are currently pending implementation.

### 6.1. High Priority

-   **/alerts Endpoint Full Functionality**:
    -   The `/api/alerts` endpoint needs to be fully integrated to show all violation types.
    -   Connect alert generation to push/email notification services.
    -   Ensure alerts related to screen captures include a secure link to the screenshot thumbnail.

-   **/consent Endpoint Full Integration**:
    -   **Pause/Resume Logic**: Fully implement the logic to pause and resume all monitoring services based on user consent.
    -   **Data Retention**: Implement an automated data retention policy to delete monitoring data after a configurable period, respecting user privacy.

-   **Reports Explainability**:
    -   Enhance reports to include AI "explainability" data. For example, a low productivity score should be explained with data on idle time or non-productive applications.

### 6.2. Documentation & Cleanup

-   **Finalize GDPR.md**: Review and finalize the GDPR documentation in `/docs`.
-   **Create AUDIT_LOG.md**: Document how to use and interpret the audit logs.
-   **Create AI_SCORING.md**: Detail the logic behind the AI productivity scoring.

### 6.3. Known Issues

-   The current password storage is plain text in the database. This is a critical security flaw and **must be replaced with a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt)** before any production deployment.
-   Error handling in some older routes could be more robust.
